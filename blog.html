          Q1.What is the difference between local storage and session storage?

          <p class="bg-yellow-200 text-slate-700 rounded-lg p-4 mt-2 text-xl">
            SessionStorage is very similar to localStorage ; the difference is
            that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in
            sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a
            document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page
            session gets created and assigned to that particular tab. Session
            storage gets deleted if we reload the page or close the tab but
            local storage doesnot get deleted if we reload.

            Global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node. js,
            it's controlled by the global object. Block scopes are what we get
            when you use if statements, for statements. For instance if we
            declare a variable globally outside any block it will be accessible
            from within any block scope but variables declared in block scopes
            will not be accessible globally.

          Q3. How does the event loop work?

        <div class="collapse-content font-semibold">
          <p class="text-2xl">Ans:Event loop:</p>
          <p class="bg-yellow-200 text-slate-700 rounded-lg p-4 mt-2 text-xl">
            To understand event loop we need to understand 3 things , which are:
            Call stack, web APIs and task queue. As javascript is a single
            threaded language , when it does something which takes comparatively
            long time than other codes it can blocks the browsers functionality
            and while running those asynchronus codes browser cant do anything
            else. Callstack is a data structure which keeps the track of the
            code that are being executed. When we run an asynchronus code , to
            avoid the browsers blocking behavior we pass the async code from the
            callstack to browsers webAPI and the async code executes there and
            the result is passed to the task queue. The eventloop loop basically
            checks the callstack if it is empty or not , if it is empty it takes
            the async codes result and passes it to stack and waits for the
            stack to clear and then pass another result fromo taskque(if any).

          Q4.What are reasons behind getting undefined in javascript?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content font-semibold">
          <p class="text-2xl">Ans:Why Undefined!:</p>
          <p class="bg-yellow-200 text-slate-700 rounded-lg p-4 mt-2 text-xl">
            There are several cases in which we can see undefined in javascript.
            But all reasons have the same core concept which is: We are trying
            to access/show/get something which is not declared or we can say
            which is not found within our script, it can be a variable or an
            object property or an array item . Also if value of a variable is an
            empty string , the type of the variable will be undefined. If we
            declare a variable but dont asssign any value then also the type of
            that variable will be undefined
